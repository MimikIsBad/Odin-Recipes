        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Corn Salsa</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the marinade by combining the chipotle chili in adobo sauce in the bowl of a food processor. Then, add in the diced onion, minced garlic, lime juice, spices, sugar, salt, black pepper, and oil. Process the ingredients for 20 to 30 seconds, until no chunks remain.</li>
        <li>Pound the chicken until it is no more than 1 inch thick in any place. Then, place the chicken and the marinade in a bowl or bag for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat up some olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the marinated chicken. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes on each side for breasts, or 9 to 10 minutes per side for thighs. Brush on any extra marinade for more flavor. The internal temperature of the chicken should be 165℉ once cooked.</li>
    </ol>
