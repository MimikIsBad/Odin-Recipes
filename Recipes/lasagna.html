        <li>Drain the excess fat and stir in the marinara sauce, letting the flavors meld for a few minutes</li>
        <li>Prepare your cheese mixture by combining the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan chees, beaten eggs, and Italian seasoning in a bowl</li>

        <li>Layer lasagna noodles, followed by a generous portion of the cheese mixture and more meat sauce. Repeat the layers until your dish is filled, finishing with a final layer of meat sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes, then uncover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving, and enjoy.</li>
